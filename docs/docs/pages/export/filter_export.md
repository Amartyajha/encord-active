# Filter & Export

## Export to COCO file

The Filter & Export feature allows you to export data according to specific metric values or the tags created during the data exploration process.

After you have created a filtering rule, click on **Generate COCO file** and sit tight, this can take up to a few minutes depending on the number of samples. 

Once the COCO file is generated, the **Download filtered data** button will unlock. Click it to download the resulting file.

## Export to Encord 

Additionally, you can also export the data directly to the Encord labelling platform. For this you will need to specify dataset and project names, and optionally a description. 

Once you are satisfied, press the **Create** button and the data will be exported to Encord.
