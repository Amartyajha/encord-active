If you haven't got such a project, you have a couple of options to migrate your data to the Encord platform:

## Import data from CVAT/COCO

If you have a CVAT/COCO project already, you can import your data into Encord easily by following these steps:

1. [Set up public key authentication with Encord](https://docs.encord.com/admins/settings/public-keys/#set-up-public-key-authentication)
2. [Import CVAT project via the SDK](https://python.docs.encord.com/tutorials/projects.html#cvat-integration) or [Import COCO using Encord Active](/cli/import-coco-project)

Again, if you need help, don't be shy to reach out on the [Slack community](https://encordactive.slack.com)!

## Migrating Data from Your Own Project

The steps you need to take to import your local data into the Encord platform is:

1. [Set up public key authentication with Encord](https://docs.encord.com/admins/settings/public-keys/#set-up-public-key-authentication)
2. [Follow step 1-3 in this tutorial](https://python.docs.encord.com/tutorials/end-to-end/preparing_data_for_labelling.html) to set up a project with Encord.
3. (optional: if you want to also import labels) [Follow this tutorial](https://python.docs.encord.com/tutorials/end-to-end/saving_labels_to_project.html) to import your labels into Encord.
