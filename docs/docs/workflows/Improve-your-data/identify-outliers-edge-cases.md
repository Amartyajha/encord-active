# Find Outliers

**Find outliers in your dataset using Encord Active's Data Quality tab**


With Encord Active, you can quickly find image outliers for pre-defined metrics, custom metrics, and label classes. 
Encord Active finds outliers using precomputed [Interquartile ranges](/pages/data-quality/summary).

 `Prerequisites:` Dataset  

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the _Data Quality_ > _Summary_ tab. Here, the [metrics](/category/metrics) will be presented as expandable panes.
2. Click on a metric to get deeper insight into _moderate outliers_ and _severe outliers_. The most severe outliers are presented first in the pane.
3. Use the slider to navigate your data from most severe outlier to least severe.
4. When you have identified outliers of interest, use the [tagging](/tags) or [bulk tagging](/tags) feature to save a group of images.
5. After creating a tagged image group, you can access it at the bottom of the left sidebar in the _Actions_ tab.
6. Within the _Actions_ tab, click _add filters_, scroll the bottom, and select _tags_. Next, choose the tags you would like to export, relabel, or delete from your dataset.
