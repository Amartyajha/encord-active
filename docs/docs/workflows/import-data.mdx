# Importing Data and Labels

:::info

There are two ways your can import a project, from an existing Encord project or from a local project in a COCO data format that will be uploaded to Encord.
If you do not have an Encord account and data on the Encord platform, we would be happy to help you getting started! Please contact us via the Slack or by shooting us an email on [active@encord.com](mailto:active@encord.com).
We will be happy to provide you with an account to get you started.

:::

To use Encord Active, you need data.
This page describes how you can get data into Encord Active.

Overall, there are two steps you need to take:

1. Get your data on the Encord Platform.
   If you have an Encord project already, that's great - you can skip to the next step.
   If not, please see the SDK section on [Migrating data to Encord](/sdk/migrating-data) for more instructions.
2. [Import the project into Encord Active](/cli/import-encord-project)

If you want to use a local project in a COCO format, you can use our [COCO importer](/cli/import-coco-project) which will do steps 1 and 2 automatically.

When you have done this, you can [run the app](/cli/open-encord-active).
