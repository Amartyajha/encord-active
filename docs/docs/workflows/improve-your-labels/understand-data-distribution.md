# Understand your label Distribution

**Get insights into the distribution of your labels with Encord Active**


Encord Active enables you to visually explore your label distribution by pre-defined metrics, custom metrics, and label classes.  
Understanding your label distribution by different metrics can help you discover gaps in your dataset to prioritise for further data collection and labelling to improve your models' performance.

`Prerequisites:` Dataset & Labels

If you have uploaded your model predictions you can combine this workflow with [Find Important Metrics](/workflows/improve-your-models/metric-importance) to better prioritise what metrics to look at.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the _Label Quality_ > _Explorer_ tab.
2. Select a metric to order your data by in the dropdown menu top left (e.g. Brightness or Aspect Ratio).
3. [Optional] filter your data by class or by annotator using the middle and right dropdown menu.
4. In the dashboard, you can see three different data distributions. 
   * Distribution by class: Shows the number of samples by class in the dataset.
   * Distribution by annotator: Shows the number of samples by annotator and their annotator score.
   * Distribution by metric: Shows the number of samples by metric score. 
      * Use the slider to navigate the dataset ordered by the chosen metric.
